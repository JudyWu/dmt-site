                    <p>Northwell Health, Cornell Tech and the Digital Marshmallow Test (“DMT”) research team recognize the importance of protecting your personal information. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

                    <p>By downloading and using the DMT mPulse app (the “App”) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in the DMT mPulse Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”).</p>

                    <h3>What information does the DMT mPulse app collect?</h3>

                    <p>The App does <u><b>not</b></u> collect any personally identifying information. The App does collect your responses to surveys and game-like tasks, along with your phone’s battery level while you are completing surveys and games.</p>

                    <p>After you use the App for 7 days, you will be prompted to send an email pre-filled with a completion code to the research team. This completion code does not link your email address to your test data. The App will trigger your external mail app to send the email, therefore, your email address is never entered into the App.</p>

                    <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>

                    <p>Although your name is never entered into the App, we still use a random code on all your test data rather than any personally identifying information. This unique code cannot be used to directly re-identify you because you are not providing any identifying information to begin with. The test data is stored on a secure server that is under the control of Sage Bionetworks, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research organization. <u><b>Users may contact the research team at any time with questions or concerns, but do not have to provide any personally identifying information</b></u>.</p>

                    <p>We will not access any content on your mobile phone, including other applications or personal information such as websites visited, text message content, or personal contacts or photos. The only information we are collecting from your phone is its battery level when you complete the surveys and games.</p>

                    <h3>How will we share any of the information we receive from you?</h3>

                    <p>We will not share your information with any commercial third parties including advertising agencies, with the exception of other collaborating research teams for the sole purpose of advancing the research. The only individuals who have access to your test data are those who are on the DMT research team or researchers who have obtained permission to work on the App protocol. These other collaborating researchers will be sent already de-identified, encrypted test data via email which is supported on Northwell Health’s secure server.</p>

                    <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

                    <p>We will combine your test data with those of other users. The combined data will be used only by researchers who are permitted to collaborate on the App protocol.</p>

                    <p>Results of this test may be published in scientific journals or presented at research conferences, but will not include any personal information.</p>

                    <h3>Questions?</h3>

                    <p>Please send all questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy to <a href="mailto:rvitale@northwell.edu">rvitale@northwell.edu</a>.</p>
